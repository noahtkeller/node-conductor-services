NodeJS implementation of some conductor services  
This is an example of how the [node-common-backend/services](https://github.com/noahtkeller/node-common-backend) and [node-scrapers](https://github.com/noahtkeller/node-scrapers/) abstractions
can be utilized as [Conductor](https://netflix.github.io/conductor/) services.

Not much to see here yet.
